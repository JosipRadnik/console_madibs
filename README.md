A simple madibs game used for string manipulating practice.

The game is called MAD LIBS, not MADIBS... The title of the repository is spelled wrong...

This app doesn't work on VSC terminal. Error: "Global evaluation requires a thread to have been loaded.".

Download the project, and run (through the Windows CMD) "main.dart" file located inside the "lib" folder.
